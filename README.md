# Hands-on with Go [Video]
This is the code repository for [Hands-on with Go [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/hands-go-video?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781789132519), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Go has moved from the state of tentative to mass adoption. Its C-like speed, simplicity, and power for a growing number of systems level programming domains make it an attractive option for programmers working with older cumbersome, statically typed languages. 
This course will help you learn Go programming language by solving commonly faced problems by developers in a Recipe approach. You will start by installing Go binaries and get familiar with tools to develop application. Then you will manipulate with strings and then use them in built in constructions and built-in function constructs to create a complex value from two floating-point values. Then you will learn to perform arithmetic operation date and time along with parsing them from string values.
Whether you are an expert programmer or a fresh starter, you will learn how various answers are programmed in Go language, which will take you to the next level in your mastering at Go. These recipes will be from concurrency in Go, performing various web programming tasks, doing system programming, reading and writing files, and many fundamental Go programming skills such as proper error handling, doing logging, and so on.
